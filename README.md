A collection of practice code and projects for CIT11: Introduction to Programming Java
My name is Chad LeMasters and I am pursuing an education in Information Technology.
I have always taken an interest to computing systems and the logic/code that is used to make computers perform such complex tasks.
My interest in Information Technology began at Moon Area High School where I began taking as many computer information classes as I could.
I am hoping to find a career in the Computing and technology field, I currently take residence in the Pittsburgh Area and take pride in local business and culture.
